## Professional Summary

I am passionate about identifying patterns in data and using data-driven decisions to effect change in healthcare and health sciences research. I have a strong educational background and significant real-world experience in applied statistics and data sciences, including modern machine learning and deep learning architectures. I enjoy using my knowledge to contribute collaboratively on research that impacts clinical practice and provision of medicine.  

My 6 years of experience in clinical research and statistics, and 3+ years of processing and integrating multimodal data sources (text, clinical, electronic-health-record, wearable, biologic, continuous- and discrete-time), and applying AI and ML techniques (neural networks, clustering, tree-based classifiers, etc.) have prepared me for a position as a Health Sciences Researcher.

## Motivation...
I have a passion for identifying patterns in data and for using those patterns to make predictions and guide clinical management for medically complex injuries! I have a strong foundation in applied mathematics, including modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems. I am well-experienced in processing various data types (tabular, image, text), caplitalizing on a variety of feature sources (bench/clinical research, electronic medical records, imaging), and applying a diverse range of AI and ML techniques (Neural Networks, Clustering Algorithms, Tree-Based Classifiers, etc.) to predict health outcomes in children and adults. I am uniquely experienced in repeated measures and longitudinal data, including in my dissertation which explores discrete-time data (daily subject activity paterns) and in a side-project which explores continuous-time data (tri-axial accelerometer signal).  
<br>
I thrive when allowed to leverage conventional statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to make sense out of imperfect data. I am looking for a career that allows me to use these tools to tackle increasingly complex problems in fields where simple solutions fall short!  
<br>

## What I am looking for...
I am ahead of schedule in my progress toward a dissertation defense in 2026. I am currently searching for opportunities to use my passion and skills in AI and Machine Learning to contribute to a team of researchers looking to make an impact on real-world problems.

## Work Examples: 

**Dissertation:** Longitudinal and joint-modeling analyses of repeated measures data for patients with concussion.  
Summary: Data processing and analysis workflows for longitudinal exploration of wearable device activity data in a 
clinical research setting, implementing functions to handle repeated measures, define patient-specific monitoring periods, 
and analyze using longitudinal and joint-modeling methods.  
Project Repo: https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Dissertation_wingersonMJ
<br>

**Like-Me Clinical Aggregation:** A framework for aggregating recovery outcomes among past patients based on similarity matching of clinical characteristics.  
Summary: This patients-like-me aggregation approach generates sub-cohorts that better reflect individual clinical presentations and recovery trajectories, offering an interpretable, data-driven complement to clinical management and supporting patient-centered discussions of expected recovery.  
Project Repo: https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Like-Me_Clinical_Aggregation 
<br>

**NeurIPS 2025 Submission:** Leveraging ordinal embeddings for predicting and generalizing health outcomes: A study of adolescent substance use.  
Summary: Deep representation learning for large-scale adolescent health data; introduced ordinal embeddings that outperform and better generalize to hold-out data than one-hot encoded baselines on substance-use risk prediction.  
Project Repo: https://github.com/wingersonMJ/2025_NeurIPS_Submission/
<br>

**Decision Tree:** A clinically intuitive approach to predicting persisting symptoms after concussion in adolescents.  
Summary: Interpretable decision-tree classifier for clinical use; tuning of hyperparameters, including depth, minimum samples per split, re-weighting for class imbalances, and cost-complexity pruning with selection of alpha value; stratified K-fold validation for model performance; bootstrapping with replacement for confidence intervals; variations of decision-tree visual representations for immediate use in clinical settings.  
Project Repo: https://github.com/wingersonMJ/Decision_tree_prediction 
<br>

**PropensityBatchRandomization:** A tool for randomizing participant biological samples across plates/batches while numerically evaluating the balance of key participant covariates post-randomization.  
Summary: Python package, published on PyPI, open source with tutorial; providing a structured tool for randomizing participant biological samples across plates/batches and numerically evaluating and balancing key participant covariates post-randomization; primary objective to mitigate batch effects encountered in analysis of biologics.  
Project Repo: https://github.com/wingersonMJ/PropensityBatchRandomization 
<br> 

**Ensemble Learning of Proteomics Prediction Models:** This project is the start of model building for a study that uses proteomics to predict curve severity in patients with scoliosis.  
Summary: The objective is to take information gained about cellular functions, disease states, and biological pathways obtained from analyses of 7,500 proteins to estimate a patient's Max Cobb angle - the largest point of spinal curvature measured in degrees on an X-ray. I trained multiple neural networks to predict the target variable, then used ensemble learning by training a stacked linear regression on the network outputs.
