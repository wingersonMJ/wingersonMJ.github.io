## Motivation...
I have a passion for identifying patterns in data and for using those patterns to make predictions and guide clinical management for medically complex injuries! I have a strong foundation in applied mathematics, including modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems. I am well-experienced in processing various data types (tabular, image, text), caplitalizing on a variety of feature sources (bench/clinical research, electronic medical records, imaging), and applying a diverse range of AI and ML techniques (Neural Networks, Clustering Algorithms, Tree-Based Classifiers, etc.) to predict health outcomes in children and adults. I am uniquely experienced in repeated measures and longitudinal data, including in my dissertation which explores discrete-time data (daily subject activity paterns) and in a side-project which explores continuous-time data (tri-axial accelerometer signal).  
<br>
I thrive when allowed to leverage conventional statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to make sense out of imperfect data. I am looking for a career that allows me to use these tools to tackle increasingly complex problems in fields where simple solutions fall short!  
<br>

## What I am looking for...
I am ahead of schedule in my progress toward a dissertation defense in 2026. I am currently searching for opportunities to use my passion and skills in AI and Machine Learning to contribute to a team of researchers looking to make an impact on real-world problems.

**Decision Tree:** A clinically intuitive approach to predicting persisting symptoms after concussion in adolescents.  
Summary: Interpretable decision-tree classifier for clinical use; tuning of hyperparameters, including depth, minimum samples per split, re-weighting for class imbalances, and cost-complexity pruning with selection of alpha value; stratified K-fold validation for model performance; bootstrapping with replacement for confidence intervals; variations of decision-tree visual representations for immediate use in clinical settings.

**Ensemble Learning of Proteomics Prediction Models:** This project is the start of model building for a study that uses proteomics to predict curve severity in patients with scoliosis.  
Summary: The objective is to take information gained about cellular functions, disease states, and biological pathways obtained from analyses of 7,500 proteins to estimate a patient's Max Cobb angle - the largest point of spinal curvature measured in degrees on an X-ray. I trained multiple neural networks to predict the target variable, then used ensemble learning by training a stacked linear regression on the network outputs.

## Quick examples of contributions to science, clinical practice, and concussion rehabilitation:

<img src="figs/pa_sleep_km.png" alt="Sleep and PA Kaplan-Meier Curve" width="380" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
**Combined effects of sleep and exercise:** Adolescents with acute concussion (sustained within 21-days of assessment) benefit from engagement in both post-injury exercise and quality sleep (i.e., +Ex/+Sleep group, blue) compared to 
engaging in one or neither of these pro-recovery behaviors. This means a shorter symptom duration and a quicker time to return-to-play.

**Exercise test performance and prescribing post-concussion exercise as medicine:** If exercise is medicine for concussion, how do we effectively prescribe exercise for patients in a clinical setting? One approach is 
to use systematic exercise testing to gradually increase patient heart-rate (over 10-15 minutes of exercise) until symptoms worsen, then prescribe exercise as a heart-rate that is just slightly below the intensity 
that caused the symptom increase. Here, we describe the progression of heart-rate, visual analog scale symptom reporting (0 = no symptoms, 10 =the worst symptoms), and rating of percieved exertion (6 = rest, 20 = maximum effort).

<img src="figs/HRt_vs_HRMax.png" alt="Exercise test HRt vs 50% of HRmax" width="500" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
**Evaluating alternatives to exercise testing:** If exercise testing is the gold-standard for determining an appropriate post-concussion exercise intensity (based on heart-rate), then what do we do when exercise testing is 
not an option, such as when the equipment is not available or when patients are too symptomatic? One alternative is to calculate the patients age-predicted maximum heart-rate (HRm: 220bpm minus their age [in years]; 203bpm for a 17-year-old), 
then prescribe 50% of that number as a starting place for the patient. The patient can then increase by ~5% of HRm (from 50% to 55%) each day they tolerate exercise at that intensity and do not experience a symptom increase. But is this HRm-based alternative method anywhere close to the actual heart-rate patients can achieve on exercise testing? In other words, is it accurate compared to the gold-standard? We found that it is NOT! Starting exercise at 50% of your HRm is a significantly lower intensity than would be prescribed through standardized exercise testing. In fact, **it would take on average 6-days of incrementally increasing your exercise intensity through the alternate HRm method to finally 
reach the exercise intensity that you would've began with had you just completed an exercise test.** That means ~1-week of sub-optimal exercise post-concussion, with downstream effects on recovery and potential delays in return-to-play.

**Predicting PSaC after concussion:** Can we predict Persisting Symptoms after Concussion (PSaC), defined as symptoms lasting >28 days, using just two post-concussion factors - self-reported symptom severity and 
time since injury? Our decision tree uses these two pieces of information to derrive a relative risk of PSaC for patients presenting to specialty sports medicine care after sustaining a concussion.

**Initially exploring biomarkers of physiological recovery from concussion:** Glutathione, Glutamate, Choline, and Myo-Inositol - all potential markers of physiological recovery from concussion - are relatively stable when compared 
between two post-concussion timepoints, the first of which was ~18 days post-injury and the second was following patient return to sport participation. These neurometabolites may be acute markers of concussion, but their utility 
in return-to-play decision making remains limitted at this point.

**Using >7,000 proteins to predict curve severity in children with Scoliosis:** A weighted mean ensemble approach, combining predictions from 10 independently developed neural networks, can *somewhat* predict an important 
feature of scoliosis in children.
